# Reproducible-ML-Reports-with-YAML-Configs
we will explore the process of building and managing machine learning reports using the configuration files and generate HTML reports. For this simple machine learning project, I will use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. The objective of this ML project is to predict whether a person has a benign or malignant tumor.

1. We will first build a classification model in a conventional way.
2. We will build the same model using YAML configuration file.
3. Finally, we will generate HTML report and save it.
